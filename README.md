#Project Summary

This project is a web-based multiplayer Snake game, built with a Python backend and an HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend, powered by an SQLite database. The project allows users to create accounts, customize profiles, make friends, communicate with each other, and challenge friends to a competitive multiplayer game of Snake. The game follows classic Snake rules, with the goal being for the player with the longest-surviving snake to win.

The server is created using Python's Flask framework, which hosts the website. The application makes use of various libraries, including flask-session for session management, flask-bcrypt for user authentication, and flask-socketio to handle real-time multiplayer features. The frontend is designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a user-friendly interface, while SQLite manages the user data and interactions.
